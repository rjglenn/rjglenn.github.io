My goal this summer is to create a webpage of mapping resources for those who may find them useful on the North Slope. For example, hunters and local scientists alike rely on high resolution images of sea ice to monitor ice conditions during periods of high subsistence or research activities. Previously, this location-specific data was hunted down daily on the National Snow and Ice Data Center website, downloaded, and sent out to those who might find it useful. My goal is to streamline this process to make the data more easily accessible, as well as identify products that might be useful but no one is using.
